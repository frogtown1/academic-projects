This project applies an in-depth exploratory factor analysis (EFA) in the workplace to assist human resource managers in identifying employees who are potentially high-risk sexual harassers. At the very least, being at least aware of the latent structures behind sexual compulsivity will motivate a proactive approach to safeguarding the workplace from such disruptive incidents.
