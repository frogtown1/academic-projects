This project applies a series of regressional analyses (linear, multiple and logistical) on 2015 tract census data of NYC to assist
a growing gas company in determining which tract areas would be most ideal for a gas station. Ideal location indicators were assumed to have (1) a high commute time, (2) a high percentage of drivers/carpoolers and (3) a population with a high household income to sustain gas expenditures.
